# Repository Cleanup Summary

## ✅ Good News: Your VS Code Updates Are Already Live!

After analyzing your repository, I can confirm that:

1. **Your main branch contains all your VS Code updates** - The latest commits by Alan W. P. Gallagher from December 22-23, 2025 are all there
2. **Your website is successfully deployed** - GitHub Pages deployed your latest changes on December 23, 2025 at 16:02 UTC

## What Needs Cleanup

### Stale Feature Branches (Safe to Delete):
These branches were already merged into main and can be safely deleted:

1. **copilot/merge-with-main-branch** - Merged in PR #10
2. **copilot/fix-pages-build-deployment** - Merged in PR #12

### Failed/Incomplete Branches (Safe to Delete):
These were attempts that didn't complete and can be deleted:

3. **copilot/add-images-9-10-11-12** - From draft PR #4 (unable to complete)
4. **copilot/add-images-to-assets-folder** - From draft PR #2 (unable to complete)

### This Cleanup Branch:

## Recommended Actions

### Option 1: Just Verify (Recommended)
1. Visit https://www.waylight-atlantic.co.uk
2. Verify your recent changes are visible
3. Close this PR without making any changes - everything is already correct!

### Option 2: Clean Up Old Branches
If you want to tidy up the repository:
1. Delete the 5 stale branches listed above via GitHub's web interface
2. Close draft PRs #2 and #4 that failed
3. Keep your main branch exactly as it is

## Important: No Code Changes Needed

**The repository is already in the correct state.** Your VS Code updates are on main and deployed live. This cleanup is only about removing old branches if you want a tidier repository - it won't affect your live website at all.

## Deployment Details

- **Domain:** waylight-atlantic.co.uk
- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages
- **Source:** /public directory from main branch
- **Auto-deployment:** Enabled (deploys on every push to main)
- **Last successful deployment:** Run #11, December 23, 2025

---

**Conclusion:** Your website is live with all your recent VS Code updates. No action is required unless you want to delete old branches for cleanliness.
